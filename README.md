> **Early development** — balance and features are still evolving. Saves, badges, and leaderboard entries are stored locally in your browser.

## Features

| | |
|---|---|
| **Two maps** | **USA** — 50 major metros. **NYC** — landmark stops with water crossings and bridges. |
| **Two modes** | **Tycoon** — milestones and win conditions. **Survival** — endure escalating demand and climb the leaderboard. |
| **Deep building** | Standard, high-speed, and maglev track · mid-line junctions · station capacity upgrades · train tiers. |
| **Living network** | Rush-hour demand, transfers, overcrowding pressure, demand surges, share cards, and run history. |

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the printed URL (default `http://localhost:5173`).

## How to play

1. **Build stations** — Station tool → click a stop. On the USA map, expand into gray metros (cost scales with city size).
2. **Lay track** — Pick a track type, click station to station. Tracks auto-connect through stationed cities on the line. Click an existing segment to branch via a junction.
3. **Buy a train** (`B`) — Click stops in order to set a loop route, then **Done**.
4. **Earn & reinvest** — Passengers pay fares; maintenance and ops drain cash. Upgrade track and trains in **Select** mode.

**Track types:** Standard (Tier I) · High-Speed (Tier I–II) · Maglev (Tier III only)  
**Tips:** Network overview (`O`) · Past runs (clock icon) · Share your network from the HUD

## Game modes

| | **Tycoon** | **Survival** |
|---|---|---|
| **Goal** | Milestones + win conditions | Badges + personal best time |
| **Fail state** | Bankruptcy below **−$250k** | **Network collapse** (sustained high Lost/min) |
| **Pressure** | Linear demand growth | Compound growth, tighter crowding |
| **HUD** | Time elapsed | Survived + Lost/min + strikes |

The sim clock starts when the **first passengers spawn** — build freely until riders appear.

### Tycoon

Open **Milestones** (medal icon). Expand to all **50 US metros** or reach **$5M cash** to win. Stay above **−$250k** or face bankruptcy after a grace period.

### Survival

No bankruptcy — survive as long as you can. **Lost/min** above **15** for too long triggers **network collapse**. **16 badges** across duration, skill, network, expert, and a **Jack of all trades** capstone. Sim-time counts (4× speed does not shorten duration badges).

## Controls

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| Drag / scroll | Orbit / zoom |
| `0` | Pan map |
| `1`–`6` | Tools (select, station, tracks, bulldoze) |
| `B` | Train shop |
| `O` | Network overview |
| `Space` | Pause |
| `Esc` / right-click | Cancel |

Progress autosaves to `localStorage`. **New Game** resets the current run; Survival badges and personal best persist.

## Deployment

**Live:** [overlandgame.netlify.app](https://overlandgame.netlify.app/)

Pushes to `main` also build `dist/` and deploy to **`gh-pages`** via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

<details>
<summary>GitHub Pages setup & troubleshooting</summary>

**Settings → Pages → Source:** Deploy from branch **`gh-pages`** / **`/ (root)`**

If you see `Branch "main" is not allowed to deploy to github-pages`:

1. **Settings → Environments → `github-pages`**
2. **Deployment branches** → **No restriction** (or add `main` and `gh-pages`)
3. Disable **Required reviewers** if enabled
4. Re-run the failed deploy

The red **pages build and deployment** bot job is optional; the workflow deploy is what updates the site.
