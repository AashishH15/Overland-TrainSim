# 3DTrainSim: A Low-Poly 3D Train Network Builder

A browser-based train tycoon game built with Three.js. Design, build, and operate
a passenger rail network across two scales:

- **USA National Map** - connect the 50 most-populated U.S. metro areas.
- **NYC City Map** - build a commuter network through low-poly NYC landmarks
  (Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building, Times Square, Central Park...).

## Play

**Play in your browser: https://aashishh15.github.io/3DTrainSim/**

Or run locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the printed local URL (default http://localhost:5173).

## How to play

1. **Build stations:** pick the Station tool and click a stop. On the USA map you
   start in 12 major metros — click gray stops to **expand your network** into
   new cities (cost scales with metro size). On the NYC map every landmark is
   available from the start.
2. **Lay track:** pick a track type and click station-to-station. Water
   crossings in NYC cost x2.6 (bridges are rendered automatically).
   - Standard Track: cheap, Tier I trains only
   - High-Speed Track: Tier I & II
   - Maglev Guideway: Tier III only
3. **Buy a train** and click stations in order to set its loop route, then
   press Done (or Enter).
4. Passengers spawn at stations based on demand and rush-hour cycles, board
   trains heading to their destination, and pay fares scaled by distance and
   train tier. Track maintenance and train operating costs drain cash - stay
   above -$250k or you go bankrupt.
5. **Milestones** track your progress (medal button in the HUD). Expand your
   network, grow revenue, and hit win conditions — all **50 US metros** or
   **$5M cash**. You can keep playing after a win.
6. Track can be **upgraded** in place (click it in Select mode) and demolished
   for a 25% refund. Trains can be sold for 50%.

### Controls

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| Drag / scroll | Orbit / zoom the camera |
| `0` | Move / pan map |
| `1`-`6` | Select tools (select, station, tracks, bulldoze) |
| `B` | Train shop |
| `M` | Switch between USA and NYC maps |
| `Space` | Pause |
| Right-click / `Esc` | Cancel current action |

Progress autosaves to localStorage; "New Game" resets.

## Deployment

**Live site:** https://aashishh15.github.io/3DTrainSim/

Pushes to `main` build and push `dist/` to the **`gh-pages` branch** via
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (Vite `base` is set to `/3DTrainSim/` in CI).

### Required GitHub settings

**Pages source:** **Deploy from a branch** → **`gh-pages`** → **`/ (root)`** (you already have this).

**Why Actions shows a red ❌:** Two workflows run on every push:

| Workflow | Branch | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Deploy to GitHub Pages** ✅ | `main` | Builds the site and pushes `dist/` to `gh-pages` |
| **pages build and deployment** ❌ | `gh-pages` | GitHub’s bot publishes the branch to Pages |

Your green checkmark is workflow #1. The red X is workflow #2 failing — usually **environment protection** on the `github-pages` environment.

**Fix the red X (one time):**

1. **Settings → Environments → github-pages**
2. Under **Deployment branches**, choose **No restriction** (or add **`gh-pages`** to the allowed list)
3. Save, then **Actions → pages build and deployment → Re-run all jobs** (or push any commit to `main`)

The site may already be live at https://aashishh15.github.io/3DTrainSim/ even while the bot workflow shows failed — the files on `gh-pages` are correct; GitHub’s publish step is what’s blocked.

## Tech

- Three.js (vanilla), Vite
- d3-geo Albers-USA projection + us-atlas TopoJSON for the national map
- Graph-based track network (Dijkstra pathfinding for trains and fares)
- Tick-based passenger/economy simulation decoupled from the render loop
